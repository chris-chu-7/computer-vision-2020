In this homework assignment, I have learned to perform 2 various tasks:

1. Generate a Collage with channels. For this task, I created a red, green, and blue channel for the Vincent Van Gogh images, respectively,
and subsquently. I did this by extracting the 1,2, and 3 matrix elements from the image, respectively, and created a 2x2 matrix with all
of the images nested inside of it, thus creating a collage. 

2. Superimpose an image on top of another, while resizing the image to be the same size. I used the image threshold equivalent to 0.5 here, and create
2 heights to resize images to 500 px and 400px, respectively. After padding the left and right of the matrix, I reset the height and width
and paddded the top and bottom of the matrix. I burned the logo onto the manhattan scene by setting the green and blue values to 0 and resizing a 
binary mask and adding a matrix value with the value iresizedmask.
